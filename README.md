# FocusApp
A pomodoro app that keeps track of task completion for each session.

"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student." - Wikipedia

Many college students, including myself, use the pomodoro method to optimize work sessions. I've developed an app that allows students focused study session and integrates a simply daily task progression tracker. The pomodoro timer was made using a custom timer class to provide ease with stops and starts to sessions. Audio and push notifications are triggered at the end of each session.

Next steps for this project include music integration using Apple's MusicKit to offer users local background study audio.
